public class WhileLoopBreak { 
 public static void main(String[] args) { 
 int count = 0; 
 while (count < 5) { 
 System.out.print(count + " "); 
 count++; 
 if (count == 3) break; 
 } 
 System.out.println(count); 
 } 
}


as 0<5 is true it will print
0
then increment by 1 of count 1<5 is true will print
1
then increment by 1 of count 2<5 is true will print
2
then increment by 1   
but we have a break statement in if when count == 3 the loop is breaked
and again it will print 
3

the output will be
0 1 2 3

for the first step in for loop the value of i =5 gets added to the
total so total=5 in that the total will get -1 so the total equals 4   

for the second step in for loop the value of i =4 gets added to the
total so total=8 in that the total will get -1 so the total equals 7  

for the third step in for loop the value of i =3 gets added to the
total so total=10 in that the total will get -1 so the total equals 9  

for the fourth step in for loop the value of i =2 gets added to the
total so total=11 in that the total will get -1 so the total equals 10  

for the fifth step in for loop the value of i =1 gets added to the
total so total=12 in that the total will get -1 so the total equals 11

public class DoWhileLoop {

as do-while loop check the condition at least once so it will print the value of i which is
1
increment by 1 so 2<5 which is true then it will print 
2
increment by 1 so 3<5 which is true then it will print 
3
increment by 1 so 4<5 which is true then it will print 
4
increment by 1 so 5<5 which is false then it will break
and then i=5

the output will be
1 2 3 4 5
